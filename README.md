# 1. National Hostel Placement Service
## 1.1 Background
Traditionally, dealing with the homeless has been the job of local authorities and not that of central governement. The diagram below shows the criteria a person must fulfil before being accepted as homeless.

Normally, the following groups of people are considered to be in priority need of accommmodation:
- People who have dependent children
- Pregnant women
- People who are homeless because of a fire, flood, or similar emergency
- People who are vulnerable because of:
- - Old age
- - Mental illness or handicap
- - Physical disability
- - Special reasons

However, it can be seen that this method of assessment can put a serious burden on a local authority's housing service. In fact , with the growing number of applications by honeless people people, and their acceptance, housing services are being put under considerable pressure. Coupled with reduced staff and in some cases insufficient funds, it is not surprising to find applications not being dealt with properly, and priority applications being delayed.

## 1.2 The National Hostel Placement Service
The National Hostel Placement Service (NHPS) is fictional organisation, founded by a group of probabtion officers and social workers. They recognised the need for a central referral agency, for places in residential units which would alleviate the accommodation problems facing many of their clients.
